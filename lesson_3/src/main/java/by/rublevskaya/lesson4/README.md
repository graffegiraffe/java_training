# Here, the following tasks are implemented:
0. Create an array of integers. Write a program that outputs a message about whether the specified number is in the array or not.
Let the number to search be specified from the console (Scanner class).

1. Create an array of integers. Remove all occurrences of the specified
number from the array.
Let the number be specified from the console (Scanner class). If there is no such number,
output messages about it.
The result should be a new array without the specified number.

2. Create and fill the array with random numbers and output the
maximum, minimum, and average values.
Use the Math.random() method to generate a random number.
Let it be possible to create an array of arbitrary size.
Let the array size be entered from the console.

3. Create 2 arrays of 5 numbers.
Output the arrays to the console in two separate lines.
Calculate the arithmetic mean of the elements of each array and
report for which of the arrays this value was greater (or
report that their arithmetic means are equal).
